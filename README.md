# pig-game
This program builds a dice game called Pig where two players alternate turns rolling a dice. 
During their turn, the sum of the rolls is added to the players score until they decide to  
stop or they roll a 1. If the player rolls a 1, then their turn ends and they lose all the  
accumulated points from that turn. The first player who scores 50 points wins the game.
